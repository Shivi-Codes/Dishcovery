## Technologies Used

- **Storage:** LocalStorage for saving favorite recipes
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast and optimized development

## Running the Project

Dishcovery is built using Vite as a Vanilla JavaScript project. To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dishcovery.git
   cd dishcovery
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the project in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Branching Strategy & Code Review Process

We follow a feature-branch workflow to ensure a clean and structured development process.

### Creating a Branch

1. Fetch the latest changes and create a new branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b task/ticket_4-create-recipe-card
   ```

### Committing & Pushing Code

2. Add changes and commit with a meaningful message:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implemented recipe card component"
   ```
3. Push changes to the remote branch:
   ```sh
   git push origin task/ticket_4-create-recipe-card
   ```

### Code Review & Merging

4. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub:

   - Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
   - Request at least one team member to review the code.
   - The code author cannot merge their own PR; approval is required.

5. Once approved, merge the PR into `main`.

6. Delete the feature branch after merging:
   ```sh
   git branch -d task/ticket_4-create-recipe-card
   git push origin --delete task/ticket_4-create-recipe-card
   ```
